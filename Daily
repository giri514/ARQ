For P1 and P2 we need to first call CIM and informed him/her about the action plan [anytime]
If we are not able to resolve this then during business hours escalate it to associate / after hours escalate it to MHT/Linux
If you are able to resolve then for prod env call the customer after CIM
And if you are escalating for prod servers then call the customer after the escalation

For P3 during business hours escalate all calls to on-call associates
After hours escalate the incidents to MHT or Linux [as per customer environment]

Requests need to escalate to the msg-mss-team slack channel during business hours
In after-hours only if the customer calls and confirmed it is urgent then escalate to MHT or Linux
